title: "Year 2 Block B - Advanced Programming Concepts"
period: "November 2021 - February 2022"
tags: ["Advanced C++", "System Design", "Professional Development"]
---

## Overview

This block emphasized advanced programming techniques, system design patterns, and professional development skills. I continued to build upon my graphics programming knowledge while expanding into broader software engineering practices.

**Key Focus Areas:** Advanced C++, System Design, Professional Development

## Weekly Progress Highlights

Progress Report	Must be updated every week
Students report what they have done each week. It shows in-progress work, provides links to the work, and summarizes the feedback on progress made. 
Section C – Summary of ILO evidence	Must be completed in week 8
Students summarize their evidence for each of the Intended Learning Outcomes of this block, and self-assess based on the provided detailed rubric.
Section D – Block Reflection		Must be completed in week 8
Students reflect on their progress during the block, and set learning goals going forward.

Self-study goals
UE4 C++ Implementation

To implement the majority of my features in C++ in Unreal this block by strengthening my understanding of Unreal from the C++ perspective.
Exploring UE4 Materials in more depth

I want to learn in more depth how to manipulate the UE4 materials system to create unique systems in games.

Weekly Progress
Report

### Week 1


What went well? I got along well with my team and we thought through a great deal of concepts to arrive at one we all somewhat agreed with
What didn’t go so well? We weren't completely happy with our chosen concept so we took some time on Thursday to rework it into something that we were happier with based on the feedback we received
What did you learn? I learned that when coming up with concepts in small teams we can use input from all disciplines as I initially assumed that concepting was mainly done by designers
Action points?I think in future we need to make a lot of concepts to then slowly narrow them down into the one we prefer rather than choosing the first best one we come up with
What did I do this week

Monday
Section A
Getting reacquainted with UE4
Tuesday
Meeting team
Concepting first game with team
Presenting game concept
Wednesday
Setting up P4 for team
Researching level streaming
Thursday
Reworked chosen concept
Implemented basic level streaming
Friday
UE4 Guild
UE4 C++ exploration and testing

### Week 2


What went well? I worked a lot in C++ in UE4 which went quite well considering it is not something I have worked much with before.
What didn’t go so well? Sublevel transformation during load-time is taking longer to implement than planned.
What did you learn? I learned how to create UE4 BP function libraries
Action points?I think for the next game I should try to get my features fully working in BP and if time is left start converting my BP work to C++
What did I do this week

Monday
Created system for designers to set level entry and exit for sublevels
Tuesday
Converted level transformation BP mostly to C++
Wednesday
Got sublevel rotations working
Thursday
Refactoring C++ code in UE4
Helping with controller support
Friday
C++ guild
Finished converting sublevel transformation blueprints to C++

### Week 3


What went well? Our game concept turned out quite well. I did well during the presentation of our game
What didn’t go so well? Procedural generation was left out of the build because we decided that it did not fit with the type of game that we ended up making in the end.What did you learn? I learned that in the concepting phase you might find that certain things do not fit well with the game in which case you can remove/rework
Action points?It would be good for the next game to make the PR constraint a more key part to the concept
What did I do this week

Monday
Combining work with other PR on team (Stefan)
Tuesday
Got sublevel transformations fully working
Set up Itch.io page
Wednesday
Setting up builds with DP
Thursday
Lecture Team communication
Presenting concept
Friday
C++ Guild
UE4 experimentation

## Block Reflection

Must be completed in week 8
Students reflect on their progress during the block, and set learning goals going forward.

## Technical Skills Developed

- **Programming Languages**: C++, C#
- **Graphics APIs**: DirectX 12, OpenGL
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Custom engine development, The Forge framework
- **Methodologies**: Agile development, SMART goal setting
- **Collaboration**: Multi-disciplinary team work, technical communication

## Key Takeaways

This block provided valuable experience in advanced c++, system design, professional development, contributing to my growth as a game developer and preparing me for industry challenges.
