title: "Year 2 Block A - Graphics Programming Exploration"
period: "September 2021 - November 2021"
tags: ["Graphics Programming", "Engine Architecture", "Team Collaboration"]
---

## Overview

During this block, I focused on exploring graphics programming concepts and working as part of a programming team on a Retro 3D Shooter project. This was my first deep dive into graphics programming fundamentals and engine architecture design.

**Key Focus Areas:** Graphics Programming, Engine Architecture, Team Collaboration

## Current State of Competency

I think I have come a long way from when I initially started at BUas, having no C++ experience at all. I think my strong suite might be my communication with other programmers as well as my communication within a multi-disciplinary team. I think I still need to find out what I want to specialise in and for this block I aim to try working as a graphics programmer as the maths and concepts that go into it interest me a lot. I do feel more confident as a programmer in general, but I know that I still have a lot of learning to do to hone my skills in order to write good code. Other than that I know that organisation is not my strong suite and I have tried in previous blocks to improve upon that, so I hope that this block will give me further opportunities to improve my organisational skills, so that I am more reliable when I transition into working in the industry.

## Learning Goals

Academic and professional practice  
Goal 01: I want to improve my work-life balance.S: I want to make sure that I don't have a burn-out by working only within assigned hours unlike last block where there were many instances where work dragged out outside of working hours.M: I can measure the amount of hours I work over-time each week and try to decrease that number if possible.A: This goal should be attainable, as it simply requires me to set a hard stopping point for myself when needed.R: It is relevant to me since I need to make sure that I don't make the same mistakes of over-working myself as I did last block.T: It will be bound to the end of this block.

	
Professional skills and knowledge
Goal 01: I want to explore what it is like to be a graphics programmer in a team.S:  I will specifically be focusing on learning the basis of knowledge needed in order to implement common and custom systems in projects as a graphics programmer.M: I am planning to work on a small side project on self-study times in order to create a small demo project of various common rendering subsystems from scratch in either DX12 or opengl.A: If I work on it during self-study time there should be plenty of time to finish this side project through which I will learn relevant skills for my goal.R: It is relevant as it will allow me to explore the skills needed to work in a team as a graphics programmer.T: It is bound to the end of the block.

## Weekly Progress Highlights

Progress Report	Must be updated every week
Students report what they have done each week. It shows in-progress work, provides links to the work, and summarizes the feedback on progress made. 
Section C – Summary of ILO evidence	Must be completed in week 8
Students summarize their evidence for each of the Intended Learning Outcomes of this block, and self-assess based on the provided detailed rubric.
Section D – Block Reflection		Must be completed in week 8
Students reflect on their progress during the block, and set learning goals going forward.

Weekly Progress

### Week 1


What went well? I got assigned to the Retro 3D shooter team which is a project I am highly enthusiastic about and I got to know my teammates, who all seem quite capable. 
What didn’t go so well? On thursday we spent a large majority of the day working on engine architecture together in a planning room together which was incredibly draining since we kept going in circles where one of us would challenge a given aspect of the engine design and we would have to justify every part that was challenged.
What did you learn? I learned that working in a team of only programmers is very different from working in a multi-disciplinary team like last block since there is already a great deal of technical understanding that everyone has, so we can communicate about technical details more effectively.
Action points?I need to think more about how we can avoid going in circles in meetings, but I am not quite sure how to, so I will perhaps have to do some research into meeting structures.
What did I do this week

Monday
Created a simple raycast renderer because the project brief inspired me
Tuesday
Kick-off
Got assigned to Retro 3D shooter team
Wednesday
Brainstorming with team
Researching rendering systems (the forge and Jeremiah's framework)
Set up Trello
Started adding information to TTD
Thursday
Worked on engine architecture with team
Researched basics of design patterns and anti-patterns
Friday
Played a bit with the Forge framework to get a basic understanding of how it works
Worked on personal side projects

### Week 2


What went well? I feel like our team made a lot of progress outlining our engine and the systems that we want to implement.
What didn’t go so well? There are some elements of the TTD which I think we still need to flesh out more, so we possibly still need to work on it next week.
What did you learn? I learned more about the PS4 architecture since we finally got access to the SDK and we were able to use that information to make our TTD more relevant to the target platform.
Action points?TTD needs further work to be at a higher standard.
What did I do this week

Monday
More work with team on engine architecture
Tuesday
Reading foundations of game engine development volume 2
Working on TTD and describing graphical subsystems of engine
Wednesday
Discussion with other graphics programmer about engine architecture and integration of graphical subsystems
Slight rework of engine architecture.
Thursday
Preparing our presentation of engine
Presenting our engine
Friday
Work on side projects
CPP guild

### Week 3


What went well? We got the forge added into our project without any major issues. We expected this to not take as long as it did, but luckily we got it working as we wanted to.
What didn’t go so well? We had to wait a decent amount of time to get access to the PS4 version of the forge as well as waiting for our perforce repo to be setup so we could start working.
What did you learn? I learned that project setup should be much more of a focus since a solid setup won't need to be adjusted as much throughout development
Action points?I plan to focus way more on project setup on the next project that I work on since having a solid setup in mind means that there won't be as many spontaneous changes.
What did I do this week

Monday
Testing building the forge from static lib
Waiting for perforce repo
Tuesday
Added the forge to our project
Changing project setup to use shared headers from same forge version
Tried to get the project running on PS4
Wednesday
Setup FSL shader translation
Created camera
Thursday
Fixed shader translation by adding python translation tools
Added shaders to project to test translation
Friday
Worked on side project exploring raycast renderer
